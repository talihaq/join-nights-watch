Project Learning Log

Hello!

This is an example of a form where the visitor applies to join the Night's Watch (from Game of Thrones). 

I assigned this project to myself and found it relatively straightforward, although aligning things the way I wanted them and getting everything responsive was tricky â€“ checked MDN for guidance a fair bit. Will continue practising responsive design to get better at this.
